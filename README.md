# 1-D-Heat-Transfer-through-Fins
In this code I have solved transient heat conduction problem in triangular fin.
Governing equation is modeled as 1-D unsteady heat conduction with varying cross sectional area.
First I have non dimensionlize the governing equation  after that descretized  the equation using FTCS implicit method.
Apply boundary condition,solve the algebraic equation using TDMA and plot various plot.
I have used MATLAB.
